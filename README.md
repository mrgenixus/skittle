# Skittle
Skittle is the name of a genome-browser tool whose purpose is to make empirical patterns in genome base-pairs visually obvious.  The fundamental fucntionality shows ACGT base pair bytes from standard genome encoding text files as, each, an individual color and supports pattern-exposing transforms to them.  The ultimate purpose was to expose informational content in genome structure which might give us the ability to distill genetic information to a vocabulary, and begin to treat it as a language from which new viable genes might be written.

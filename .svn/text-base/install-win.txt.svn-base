In order to compile Skittle Genome Visualizer on Windows you will need the following libraries:
gcc
Qt4.1 or higher
OpenGL
GLUT

1. Download Qt Development Libraries from the web: http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

2. Unpack the source files into the directory you want to work in.

3. Open up a DOS prompt in the Qt directory and use the Qt batch file to ensure all your environment variables are set:
Qt\bin\qtvars.bat

4. Navigate to the source code directory for Skittle and use qmake to build a Makefile.
qmake SkittleToo.pro

4. qmake often puts the OpenGL flags in the wrong order.  Open up Makefile.Release and Makefile.Debug and verify that your LIBS flags are in this order:
-lqtmain -lQtOpenGL -lglut32 -lglu32 -lopengl32 -lQtGui
Don't remove any other flags, just ensure that the flags present are in the correct order.

5.  Remove references to -mthreads to break the mingwm10.dll dependency like so (this is optional):
CXXFLAGS      = -O3 -frtti -fexceptions -Wall $(DEFINES)
	....
LFLAGS        =        -enable-stdcall-fixup -Wl,-enable-auto-import -Wl,-enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc -Wl,-s -Wl -Wl,-subsystem,windows

6. 'make release' to compile the project.

7. Execute SkittleToo using 'release/SkittleToo chrY-sample.fa'


I used gcc on Windows XP and Windows 7 using 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
